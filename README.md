## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Pure CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For starters, I learned that I need a lot of improvement especially when creating a responsive design since, this is my first. I learned the importance of making reusable code snippets because I had to make two separate layout for desktop and for mobile. At the end, I would say that I enjoyed it a lot. 


### Continued development

>- I want to focus on learning the responsiveness of web-pages

> - I also want to learn about REACT

### Useful resources
